# FASTQC and adapters trimming {#ch:fastqc}

`fastqc` [@Andrews2010-fk] can be used for QC of the FASTQ files.

```{bash eval=FALSE}
fastqc ../data/SRR1608610_1.fastq.gz --outdir ./data/
```

## Parallelise your `FASTQC`

This is just one example to run `fastqc` on several FASTQ files using `parallel` [@Tange_undated-th]. 

```{bash eval = FALSE}
find ./data -name "*.fastq.gz" > ./data/fastq_files.txt
cat ./data/fastq_files.txt | parallel -j 2 "fastqc {} --outdir ./data"
```

## Summarise reports with `MultiQC`

I strongly suggest to have a look at [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info/) [@Ewels2016-rc] which allows you to combine together the results of multiple samples into one compact document. You can check the programs whose output is supported by `MultiQC` (loads!!).

```{bash eval = FALSE}
multiqc ./data/ --interactive -n "FASTQC_summary" -o ./data/
```

The `FASTQC` reports offer a variety of measures and one can decide about discarding some samples or doing some adapter trimming if necessary. [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) and [Trim Galore!](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) can be used for this purpose.


## Adapter troubles: STAR vs Subread

I suggest looking at one of my previous analyses around [adapters with STAR and Subread](https://github.com/annaquaglieri16/RNA-Seq-and-adapters--STAR-vs-Subjunc) since adapters can cause serious troubles with `STAR` default settings! Regarding this I strongly suggest to look at the fragment size distribution across samples once you have aligned your fastq files. Unusual behaviour can help you spot problems with adapters/alignment steps, which I highlighted in the post. I normally use the [CollectMultipleMetrics](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/command-line-overview.html) to extract fragment sizes from Paired End (PE) bamfiles. See Section \@ref(sec:post-align) for more details.
